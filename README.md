1. A clean, from-scratch implementation of the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm, verifying the concepts presented in the seminal 1986 paper by Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams.

  This implementation relies **solely on NumPy**, avoiding high-level frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow to demonstrate the mathematical "first principles" of backpropagation.
